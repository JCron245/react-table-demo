# Table Demo


## [Reboot.scss](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/)
I work with Bootstrap quite a bit but for this project I am only using their reboot file. I like the defaults it sets for elements and how they behave, particularly I enjoy the 'border-box' applied to everything. I felt that using all of bootstrap was a bit overkill for the size of this demo and the table styling felt like it might violate the spirit of the challenge :D

In Bootstraps own words:
> Reboot, a collection of element-specific CSS changes in a single file, kickstart Bootstrap to provide an elegant, consistent, and simple baseline to build upon.

>Reboot builds upon Normalize, providing many HTML elements with somewhat opinionated styles using only element selectors.

## [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
While I didn't necessarily need React Router. I needed the ability to switch to a "detail" view on click and since React Router is the most popular way to handle routing with React it seemed like a good opportunity to use it.
